 journal hosted on Scielo. In bilingual journals, articles' titles, abstracts
 and other relevant information are retrieved in the journal's main language

 information from all articles ever published by the journal or only the ones
 in its latest issue.
}

author's names, articles' titles, year of publication, edition and number of pages,
